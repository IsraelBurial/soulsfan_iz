            Leonard Charles (Lenny) Williams was born on February 6, 1945, in Little Rock (Pulaski County); his family later moved to Oakland, California. He learned to play trumpet in elementary school. He started singing in church and considered becoming a minister before deciding to pursue a career in secular R&B.        </p>

            Williams made connections with Bay Area musicians, the most notable being Sly Stone (who fronted the legendary R&B band Sly and the Family Stone) and Larry Graham, who was Sly and the Family Stone’s bass player. He also knew members of Tower of Power, which was at that time a “blue-eyed soul” group called the Motowns. He signed his first record deal with Fantasy Records and recorded two singles: “Lisa’s Gone” and “Feelin’ Blue” (written by John Fogerty of Credence Clearwater Revival fame). He then signed briefly with Atlantic Records.        </p>
