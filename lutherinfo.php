            In 1981, Luther Vandross released his debut album, Never Too Much, which sold more than a million copies. Though Vandross was a major R&B phenomenon, it wasn't until the early 1990s that he became a pop success. He won his first Grammy in 1991 for "Here and Now," two in 1992 for "Power of Love" and a fourth in 1997 for "Your Secret Love." He also won four 2004 Grammys before passing away in 2005.        </p>

He became interested in R&B music during high school, and in 1972, his song "Everybody Rejoice" was picked up for the Broadway musical The Wiz. Soon after, he started recording commercial jingles and worked as a backup singer and arranger for such popular artists as David Bowie, Bette Midler and Barbara Streisand.
